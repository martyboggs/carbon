title: What Can One Person Do to Improve Climate Conditions
tags: [lifestyle]

A single person has two things they can offer the world: time and money.

Here's how people spend their time:

1. Working
2. Hobbies
3. Watching Teletubbies
4. Working out
5. Driving
6. Eating
7. Shopping
8. Going to the doctor

Here's how people spend their money:

1. Housing
2. Food
3. Car fees
4. Vacations
5. Clothing
6. Subscription services
7. Teletubby figurines

It's clear that we spend the most time working and the most money on housing. So for a single person to have the biggest impact, they should get a job that maximizes the impact they have on preventing climate change and choose to live somewhere that has a carbon-negative footprint.

But this is a simplistic way of maximizing your impact. We could create systems that run while we're doing other things. For example, by planting trees, the trees will continuously pull carbon out of the air while we're sleeping or at work. Or we could work with others and spark an idea that ends up creating a much bigger impact than we ever could alone.

2. **Get a job that helps change policy or educates people or shifts markets favorably**
3. **Live somewhere with a carbon-negative footprint**
4. **Sell your car and live the car-free lifestyle**

Here are other things I wrote down:

- Recycle, minimize waste
- Educate

- Green hobbies
- Green clothing
- Green teletubbies
- Green taxes?
